Project Overview->
The primary objective is to develop a web application that fetches data from an external API, visualizes the data through graphs, and provides a clean user interface (UI) with filtering capabilities.

Tasks->
1. Fetch Data from API
Objective: Make an API request to retrieve data.
API Endpoint: Random Data API - Blood Types
Task Description:
Use JavaScript (or a frontend framework/library like React, Vue, or Angular) to make an API request.
Retrieve 100 records of blood types in JSON format.
Ensure error handling is in place for network requests.
2. Data Visualization
Objective: Generate graphs to visualize the data.
Task Description:
Use a charting library (such as Chart.js, D3.js, or any preferred library) to create visual representations of the data.
Create any number of graphs to represent the blood type data effectively.
Ensure that the graphs are dynamic and update as the data changes.
3. User Interface (UI) with Filtering
Objective: Develop a clean UI with a navbar and filters.
Task Description:
Design and implement a navigation bar for the application.
Implement filters to filter the data based on "type" and "group".
Ensure that changes in the filters are reflected in the graphs in real-time.
Focus on a responsive and user-friendly design
